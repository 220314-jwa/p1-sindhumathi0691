# Java with Automation Foundations Project
# Tuition Reimbursement App

For this project, I created a full-stack application.
The biggest priority for this application is testing using (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium).

## About the Application

### TRMS: Tuition Reimbursement Management System

Tuition Reimbursement Management System is an application which allows employees at a company to submit requests for reimbursement. If the employee decides to take a certification exam or attend a class, the company may reimburse them for the cost after they submit a request. Managers can then go into the application and approve or reject requests.
## Technologies Used:

1.  Java    
2.  Maven    
3.  Postgres   
4.  DBeaver
5.  Junit
6.  Mockito
7.  Selenium
8.  Cucumber/Gherkin
9.  HTML5 / CSS 3
10. Javascript / AJAX

## Technical Requirements

1. Data must be stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database (local or AWS).
2. Data access in Java will be performed using JDBC DAOs.
3. HTTP handling in Java will be done using Javalin.
4. Service layers must be fully unit tested using JUnit and Mockito.
5. DAOs are fully unit tested using JUnit.
6. Front end must be written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries/frameworks for JS. Styling libraries like Bootstrap are fine).
7. At least one feature must have an automation test written using Selenium.

## Features
1. End2End testing using Junit and Mockito
2. Abilty to add user to tuition reimbursement
3. Signin function


Todo List
1. Fix bugs
2. Correct E2E 
4. Correct failed unit testing
5. Add Cucumber Scenarios
